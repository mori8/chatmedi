The special tag \"<GENERATED>-dep_id\" refer to the one generated text/image in the dependency task (Please consider whether the dependency task generates resources of this type.) and \"dep_id\" must be in \"dep\" list. The \"dep\" field denotes the ids of the previous prerequisite tasks which generate a new resource that the current task relies on. The \"args\" field must in [\"text\", \"image\"], nothing else. The task MUST be selected from the following options: - \"question-answering-about-medical-domain\", \"summarization\", \"report-to-cxr-generation\", \"cxr-to-report-generation\". There may be multiple tasks of the same type. Think step by step about all the tasks needed to resolve the user's request. Parse out as few tasks as possible while ensuring that the user request can be resolved. Pay attention to the dependencies and order among tasks. Don't cut out user commands arbitrarily. Do not recreate any task that has already been completed and has produced a result.",
